# Real-time Collaborative Task Manager
## Description
Create a web-based task management application where multiple users can collaborate
on tasks in real time. The application aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for
teams to manage tasks collaboratively.

1. User Authentication and Authorization
● User Registration: Users should be able to register, log in, and manage their
profiles.
● JWT-based Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication to secure user
endpoints.
● Role Differentiation: Differentiate between regular users and administrators with
appropriate permissions.
2. CRUD Operations for Tasks
● Task Management: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
● Task Attributes: Tasks should have attributes such as title, description, due date, and
assignee.
● GraphQL Integration: Implement GraphQL queries and mutations for managing tasks.
3. Real-time Updates
● GraphQL Subscriptions: Utilize GraphQL subscriptions to enable real-time
updates for changes made by other users.
● Instant Updates: Users should see instant updates when others create, update, or
delete a task.
● API Focus: No need to build the front end; APIs should be enough.
4. Node.js Backend with GraphQL API
● Backend Development: Develop the backend using Node.js to handle business
logic and task management.

● GraphQL API: Use GraphQL as the API language for efficient and flexible data
retrieval.
5. Database Storage
● Database Choice: Choose a suitable database system (e.g., PostgreSQL,
MongoDB) for storing task-related information.
● Database Schema Design: Design the database schema to represent tasks,
users, and their relationships efficiently.
6. Authentication and Security
● Secure Authentication: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to protect
user accounts and data.
● Data Security: Ensure that sensitive information is encrypted, and best practices
for security are followed.
7. Deployment
● Provide deployment scripts and documentation for setting up the application in
various environments.
Evaluation Criteria
● User Authentication & Authorization: Ability to implement user authentication and
authorization using JWT.
● Real-time Functionality: Proficiency in building a real-time application using
GraphQL subscriptions.
● Database Design: Database design skills for efficiently storing and retrieving
task-related information.
● Node.js Proficiency: Understanding of Node.js for backend development.
Bonus Points
● Task Prioritization: Implement task prioritization features.
● Notification System: Include a notification system for task updates.
● Comprehensive Testing: Provide testing for both the frontend and backend
components.
